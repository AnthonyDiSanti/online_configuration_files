Why this repository exists
==========================

Some tools, such as the popular browser plugin Adblock, do not use local
configuration files primarily.  Instead, they have their own configuration data
store.  Sometimes, these tools allow the user to define a URL where their
configuration is hosted.  This repository holds these configuration files,
hosted on GitHub.
